# Machine-Learning
When you add Jupyter Notebook or IPython Notebook files with a .ipynb extension on GitHub, they will render as static HTML files in your repository.

Download and run locally on notebool/spider.

If you're having trouble rendering Jupyter Notebook files in static HTML, you can convert the file locally on the command line by using the nbconvert command:

$ jupyter nbconvert --to html NOTEBOOK-NAME.ipynb
